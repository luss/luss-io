[CalVer](https://calver.org) is a versioning convention based on your project's release calendar, 
instead of [SemVer's](https://semver.org) arbitrary numbers.  As an example, Ubuntu uses a short 
year and a zero padded month for it's main version ala *24.04* is their latests LTS release 
from April of 2024.
